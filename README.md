# nodeJS-MIDI-listener

This is a simple NodeJS utility script that listens for and logs the output data from MIDI events (note on/off, knob/fader movements, etc) from any MIDI devices connected to your development machine.

Useful for capturing control data from MIDI devices for prototyping and development projects.

Simply clone the repo and navigate to the directory and enter:

`npm install`

`node midiListener.js`

With Nodemon installed (recommended):

`nodemon midiListener.js`
